## How it works?

    - The Smart Dustbin reads the RFID Tag in the wrapper and updates it into the firebase cloud

2. **Updates in cloud**
    - A New Entry is for the product is made against the particular user in Firebase Real time Database
    - The Firebase responds with the type of waste generated by the product.
    - This responded data is used in smart disposal by categorizing the product into biodegradable or non-biodegradable.

3. **Front end application**
    - Every item thrown is further shown in the front end applications with facilities to add, delete and modify items.
    - Every item is categorized and available suggestions are displayed alongside the percentage of saving and additional expenses incurred

4. **Analytics for the best offers**
    - The Vendors are provided with a platform to analyze the buying patterns of the customers.

    - This Rules are further subjected to the discretion of the vendor to make offers
